# Simple/Personal website
This is my personal website and is one of the first websites I have created. I am planning to make the website more reponsive but this will take a while to do. Some features on the website don't work and I'll make the changes when I have the time. There are no recommendations on how or what browser to run the website and no requirements before you run it.
