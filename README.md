# Simple/Personal website
This is my personal website and is one of the first websites I have created. I am planning to make the website more reponsive but this will take a while to do. Some features on the website don't work and I'll make the changes when I have the time. There are no recommendations on how or what browser to run the website but I use chrome to run this website.

Issues: Icon, clicking on some parts of the nav bar don't scroll down to there, hiding the icon and making it useful.
