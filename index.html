        <h3>Shape Up</h3>
        <!-- include the image of the game-->
        <p>Shape Up is a minimalist mobile puzzle game that uses all of your phone inputs including swipe, shake, tilt,
          and tap to create shapes and solve puzzles. It uses Unity for the game engine and won first place in our
          capstone class. In terms of coding, it has custom unity editor scripts to make it easy to drag and drop
          scripted effects onto shapes when events such as shake or tilt occur. I worked on the level creation as well
          as particle effects/shaders for certain shapes and I found the "juice" aspect of creation for this game to be
          fun and I would enjoy being able to work/create games like these in the future.</p>

        <h3>CMPM 121 Final Project: Farm Simulation</h3>
        <p>This game involves you growing plants and has you go to the next turn to advance the stage and grow the
          plants. While it's a simple premise there were technical requirements that needed to be met such as a language
          switch (We did TypeScript to React), being able to revert back undos and redos as well as translation of
          languages. While the game is not the prettiest to look at, it shows meets the technical requirements and shows
          off software models such as model view controller and flyweight pattern to save memory on grids of the farm.
          It also shows off abstraction of classes away from the "game engine"/game logic and makes it very simple to
          switch over
          to another renderer or language. It is a project that I am proud of as it is
          functions based as opposed to Object Oriented and doesn't have too many code smells which makes it easy to
          work on and improve in the future.</p>

        <h3>Tech Trials</h3>
        <p>Tech trials is a UI prototype that aims to help students at PVUSD (Pavoro Valley Unified School District) who
          are struggling to be motivated in learning technology. It is a simple mockup of a game that has you linking
          words together with green meaning that you go and answer questions while red causes you to have to stop
          answering them. This prototype is avaiable down below and shows off UI/UX design for a simple app.</p>
